    "The following are not valid abbreviations:\n",
    "- \"s55n\" (\"s ubsti tutio n\", the replaced substrings are adjacent)\n",

    "Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: word = \"internationalization\", abbr = \"i12iz4n\"\n",
    "- Output: true\n",
    "- Explanation: The word \"internationalization\" can be abbreviated as \"i12iz4n\" (\"i nternational iz atio n\").\n",

    "1. Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The problem asks us to determine if a given abbreviation is valid for a target word. An abbreviation is considered valid if it can be derived from the target word by replacing one or more consecutive letters with their count. For example, 'a10n' is a valid abbreviation for 'abbreviation' because it represents the 10 letters between 'a' and 'n'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example to Illustrate\n",
    " \n",
    "- “For instance, consider the target word 'internationalization' and the abbreviation 'i12iz'. This is valid because it represents the letters between 'i' and 'z' (which are 12 characters long). However, 'i11iz' would not be valid because there are only 10 characters between 'i' and 'z'.”\n",

    "- *\"As we process the abbreviation:\n",
    "    - If the current character is a letter, we check if it matches the current character in the target word. If it does, we move both pointers forward.\n",
    "    - If the current character is a digit, we need to handle it as a count of skipped characters in the target word. We extract the full number (which can be more than one digit) and advance the pointer in the target word accordingly, skipping that many characters.”*\n",
