    "- We remove the last digit from x (x //= 10).\n",
    "- We stop when reversed_half becomes greater than or equal to x. At this point, we have reversed half of the digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparison:\n",
    "- If the number is a palindrome, the two halves should be equal, i.e., x == reversed_half.\n",
    "- For odd-length numbers (e.g., 12321), we can remove the middle digit by doing reversed_half // 10 and then compare with x.\n",

    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "- O(1): We are using a constant amount of extra space for variables like reversed_half."
