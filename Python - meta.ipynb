    "# 1. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses\n",
    " \n",
    "    Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or\n",
    "    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or\n",
    "    It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"lee(t(c)o)de)\"\n",
    "    Output: \"lee(t(c)o)de\"\n",
    "    Explanation: \"lee(t(co)de)\" , \"lee(t(c)ode)\" would also be accepted.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a)b(c)d\"\n",
    "    Output: \"ab(c)d\"\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"))((\"\n",
    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "    Explanation: An empty string is also valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the Code\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched opening parentheses ( and a set called to_remove to record the indices of parentheses that need to be removed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "First Pass - Identifying Invalid Parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We iterate through each character in the string along with its index:\n",
    "    If we encounter an opening parenthesis (, we push its index onto the stack.\n",
    "    If we encounter a closing parenthesis ), we check:\n",
    "    If the stack is not empty, it means there’s a matching (, so we pop the stack (indicating a valid pair).\n",
    "    If the stack is empty, it means there’s no matching (, so we add the index of this ) to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    After finishing the loop, any indices left in the stack correspond to unmatched (. We add those indices to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create an empty list called result to hold valid characters.\n",
    "    We iterate through the original string again:\n",
    "    For each character, we check if its index is in the to_remove set. If it’s not, we append the character to result.\n",
    "    Finally, we join the characters in the result list to form the final valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively handles several edge cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: Input \"\" → Output \"\" (remains empty).\n",
    "    No Parentheses: Input \"abc\" → Output \"abc\" (remains unchanged).\n",
    "    All Unmatched Parentheses: Input \"(((\" → Output \"\" (all are unmatched).\n",
    "    Mixed Characters: Input \"a)(b(c)d)\" → Output \"ab(c)d\" (removes unmatched parentheses).\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once to identify invalid parentheses and once to build the result.\n",
    "    Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case for the to_remove set and the result list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "    How can you modify the solution to count the number of removed parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "        You could maintain a counter alongside the to_remove set to keep track of how many parentheses are marked for removal.\n",
    "    What if you were asked to return all valid strings that can be formed?\n",
    "\n",
    "        This would require a different approach, potentially involving backtracking to generate all valid combinations.\n",
    "    How would you handle a string with different types of parentheses, such as {}, [], or ()?\n",
    "\n",
    "        The logic can be extended to use a mapping of opening and closing parentheses, and you’d adjust the matching logic accordingly."

    "Initial Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem of finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique with the help of a hash set (or a dictionary). The sliding window approach allows us to maintain a dynamic range of characters while iterating through the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understanding the Problem: We need to identify substrings within the given string where no character is repeated. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and the goal is to find the maximum length of such substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a Sliding Window: By maintaining a window of characters and expanding it until we encounter a duplicate character, we can track the length of the substring dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash Set for Character Tracking: A hash set (or dictionary) is used to quickly check for the existence of a character and to efficiently manage the characters within the current window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation of the Code Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    char_set: A hash set is used to track the characters currently in the window.\n",
    "    left: This pointer indicates the start of the sliding window.\n",
    "    max_length: This variable stores the length of the longest substring found without repeating characters.\n",
    "Iterating through the String:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A for loop iterates through each character in the string with right as the right pointer of the sliding window.\n",
    "    If the character at s[right] is already in char_set, it indicates a duplicate. We enter the while loop to shrink the window from the left until the character can be added without duplication.\n",
    "Shrinking the Window:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside the while loop, characters from the left are removed from the set until s[right] can be added. The left pointer is incremented accordingly.\n",
    "Updating the Set and Maximum Length:\n",
    "\n",
    "    After ensuring that the character is unique within the window, we add s[right] to the char_set.\n",
    "    We update max_length with the maximum value between the current max_length and the current window size, which is calculated as right - left + 1.\n",
    "Returning the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, the function returns max_length, which contains the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and potentially once by the left pointer).\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The space complexity is O(min(n,m)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., 128 for ASCII). In the worst case, the size of the set could be equal to the number of unique characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: If the input string is empty, the function should return 0 as there are no characters to form a substring.\n",
    "    All Unique Characters: If all characters in the string are unique, the length of the longest substring will be equal to the length of the string itself.\n",
    "    All Same Characters: If the string consists of the same character (e.g., \"aaaa\"), the longest substring will have a length of 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "How would you modify this approach if you also needed to return the substring itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You could maintain the starting index of the longest substring found and slice the original string after the loop ends to return the substring alongside its length.\n",
    "What if the input string could include Unicode characters?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The approach remains the same, but you may need to handle the character set differently based on the encoding of the input string.\n",
    "Could you solve this problem using a different approach, such as dynamic programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "    While it’s possible to solve this using dynamic programming, the sliding window approach is typically more efficient for this problem due to its linear time complexity."

    "\n",
    "    Initialize: Start by creating an empty list to store the indices of buildings with an ocean view. Also, set a variable max_height to 0 to track the tallest building seen so far while scanning from the right.\n",

    "\n",
    "To solve the problem of finding the k closest points to the origin from a given list of points on a 2D plane, we can use a priority queue (min-heap) or simply sort the points based on their Euclidean distance from the origin. The Euclidean distance of a point (x,y) from the origin (0,0) is given by sqrt(x^2 + y^2).  However, since we only need to compare distances, we can use x^2 + y^2 directly to avoid unnecessary computation of square roots.\n",

    "Q: Can you optimize this further if k is much smaller than n?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A: Yes, we can use a max-heap of size k to store the closest points, allowing us to only keep the  k closest points while iterating through the list in O(n log k) time.\n",
    "Q: What if the input points could be negative?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A: The distance calculation x^2 + y^2 is not affected by the sign of  x or  y, so negative points are handled correctly.\n",
    "Q: Can the points be floating point values?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A: If the points are floating point values, the same logic applies since squaring will still yield valid distances, and sorting will work correctly."

    "    Empty List: If head is None, the function should return a new node pointing to itself.\n",
    "    Single Node List: If the list contains only one node, the new value can be inserted before or after it.\n",
    "    All Values Equal: If all nodes have the same value, the new value should be added without disrupting the circular structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: The traversal of the circular linked list in the worst case can take O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the list. This is because we may need to inspect each node once to find the correct insertion point.\n",
    "    Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a constant amount of space for the new node and pointers.\n",

    "Follow-up Questions and Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "What would happen if we didn’t maintain the circular nature of the list?\n",
    "\n",
    "    If we lost the circular structure, we would not be able to traverse the list correctly. This would lead to potential errors or infinite loops during traversal.\n",
    "How would you modify this solution for a doubly circular linked list?\n",
    "\n",
    "    We would need to add a previous pointer in the node structure and adjust the insertion logic to update both next and previous pointers accordingly. The traversal would also need to account for the backward movement.\n",
    "Can this solution be improved further?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Given the need to maintain sorted order during insertion, the time complexity of O(n) is optimal for this problem. However, if we had an additional data structure (like a balanced binary search tree) to maintain order, we could achieve better average search times for larger datasets, at the cost of additional complexity in insertion and deletion."
