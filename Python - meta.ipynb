    "# 1. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses\n",
    " \n",
    "    Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or\n",
    "    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or\n",
    "    It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"lee(t(c)o)de)\"\n",
    "    Output: \"lee(t(c)o)de\"\n",
    "    Explanation: \"lee(t(co)de)\" , \"lee(t(c)ode)\" would also be accepted.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a)b(c)d\"\n",
    "    Output: \"ab(c)d\"\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"))((\"\n",
    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "    Explanation: An empty string is also valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the Code\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched opening parentheses ( and a set called to_remove to record the indices of parentheses that need to be removed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "First Pass - Identifying Invalid Parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We iterate through each character in the string along with its index:\n",
    "    If we encounter an opening parenthesis (, we push its index onto the stack.\n",
    "    If we encounter a closing parenthesis ), we check:\n",
    "    If the stack is not empty, it means there’s a matching (, so we pop the stack (indicating a valid pair).\n",
    "    If the stack is empty, it means there’s no matching (, so we add the index of this ) to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    After finishing the loop, any indices left in the stack correspond to unmatched (. We add those indices to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create an empty list called result to hold valid characters.\n",
    "    We iterate through the original string again:\n",
    "    For each character, we check if its index is in the to_remove set. If it’s not, we append the character to result.\n",
    "    Finally, we join the characters in the result list to form the final valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively handles several edge cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: Input \"\" → Output \"\" (remains empty).\n",
    "    No Parentheses: Input \"abc\" → Output \"abc\" (remains unchanged).\n",
    "    All Unmatched Parentheses: Input \"(((\" → Output \"\" (all are unmatched).\n",
    "    Mixed Characters: Input \"a)(b(c)d)\" → Output \"ab(c)d\" (removes unmatched parentheses).\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once to identify invalid parentheses and once to build the result.\n",
    "    Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case for the to_remove set and the result list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "    How can you modify the solution to count the number of removed parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "        You could maintain a counter alongside the to_remove set to keep track of how many parentheses are marked for removal.\n",
    "    What if you were asked to return all valid strings that can be formed?\n",
    "\n",
    "        This would require a different approach, potentially involving backtracking to generate all valid combinations.\n",
    "    How would you handle a string with different types of parentheses, such as {}, [], or ()?\n",
    "\n",
    "        The logic can be extended to use a mapping of opening and closing parentheses, and you’d adjust the matching logic accordingly."

    "Initial Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    The problem of finding the length of the longest substring without repeating characters can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique with the help of a hash set (or a dictionary). The sliding window approach allows us to maintain a dynamic range of characters while iterating through the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Understanding the Problem: We need to identify substrings within the given string where no character is repeated. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and the goal is to find the maximum length of such substrings.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a Sliding Window: By maintaining a window of characters and expanding it until we encounter a duplicate character, we can track the length of the substring dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hash Set for Character Tracking: A hash set (or dictionary) is used to quickly check for the existence of a character and to efficiently manage the characters within the current window.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation of the Code Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    char_set: A hash set is used to track the characters currently in the window.\n",
    "    left: This pointer indicates the start of the sliding window.\n",
    "    max_length: This variable stores the length of the longest substring found without repeating characters.\n",
    "Iterating through the String:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A for loop iterates through each character in the string with right as the right pointer of the sliding window.\n",
    "    If the character at s[right] is already in char_set, it indicates a duplicate. We enter the while loop to shrink the window from the left until the character can be added without duplication.\n",
    "Shrinking the Window:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Inside the while loop, characters from the left are removed from the set until s[right] can be added. The left pointer is incremented accordingly.\n",
    "Updating the Set and Maximum Length:\n",
    "\n",
    "    After ensuring that the character is unique within the window, we add s[right] to the char_set.\n",
    "    We update max_length with the maximum value between the current max_length and the current window size, which is calculated as right - left + 1.\n",
    "Returning the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Finally, the function returns max_length, which contains the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and potentially once by the left pointer).\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The space complexity is O(min(n,m)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., 128 for ASCII). In the worst case, the size of the set could be equal to the number of unique characters in the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: If the input string is empty, the function should return 0 as there are no characters to form a substring.\n",
    "    All Unique Characters: If all characters in the string are unique, the length of the longest substring will be equal to the length of the string itself.\n",
    "    All Same Characters: If the string consists of the same character (e.g., \"aaaa\"), the longest substring will have a length of 1.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "How would you modify this approach if you also needed to return the substring itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "    You could maintain the starting index of the longest substring found and slice the original string after the loop ends to return the substring alongside its length.\n",
    "What if the input string could include Unicode characters?\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The approach remains the same, but you may need to handle the character set differently based on the encoding of the input string.\n",
    "Could you solve this problem using a different approach, such as dynamic programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "    While it’s possible to solve this using dynamic programming, the sliding window approach is typically more efficient for this problem due to its linear time complexity."

    "\n",
    "    Initialize: Start by creating an empty list to store the indices of buildings with an ocean view. Also, set a variable max_height to 0 to track the tallest building seen so far while scanning from the right.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Given two sparse vectors, compute their dot product efficiently. A sparse vector is characterized by having a majority of its elements as zero, which allows us to store only the non-zero elements and their corresponding indices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sparse Representation: Instead of storing all elements, only store the non-zero values along with their indices. This reduces memory usage and speeds up computations.\n",
    "    Dot Product Calculation: The dot product can be computed by iterating over the non-zero entries of one vector and checking for corresponding entries in the other vector. If a corresponding entry exists, multiply the values and sum them up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "    Initialize the SparseVector: Store non-zero values and their indices in a dictionary or list of tuples.\n",
    "    Compute the Dot Product:\n",
    "        For each non-zero element in one vector, check if it exists in the second vector.\n",
    "        If it does, multiply the two values and accumulate the result.\n",
    "    Return the Result: The accumulated value is the dot product of the two vectors."

    "Inner Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The inner query SELECT DISTINCT customer_id FROM Orders WHERE order_type = 0 retrieves the list of customers who have placed any order of type 0.\n",

    "    The outer query selects all orders from the Orders table.\n",
