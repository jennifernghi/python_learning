    "#Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses\n",
    " \n",
    "    Given a string s of '(' , ')' and lowercase English characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses ( '(' or ')', in any positions ) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Formally, a parentheses string is valid if and only if:\n",
    "\n",
    "    It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or\n",
    "    It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or\n",
    "    It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"lee(t(c)o)de)\"\n",
    "    Output: \"lee(t(c)o)de\"\n",
    "    Explanation: \"lee(t(co)de)\" , \"lee(t(c)ode)\" would also be accepted.\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"a)b(c)d\"\n",
    "    Output: \"ab(c)d\"\n",
    "Example 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Input: s = \"))((\"\n",
    "    Output: \"\"\n",
    "    Explanation: An empty string is also valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the Code\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create a stack to keep track of the indices of unmatched opening parentheses ( and a set called to_remove to record the indices of parentheses that need to be removed.\n",
    "    \n",
    "First Pass - Identifying Invalid Parentheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We iterate through each character in the string along with its index:\n",
    "    If we encounter an opening parenthesis (, we push its index onto the stack.\n",
    "    If we encounter a closing parenthesis ), we check:\n",
    "    If the stack is not empty, it means there’s a matching (, so we pop the stack (indicating a valid pair).\n",
    "    If the stack is empty, it means there’s no matching (, so we add the index of this ) to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    After finishing the loop, any indices left in the stack correspond to unmatched (. We add those indices to the to_remove set.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Building the Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We create an empty list called result to hold valid characters.\n",
    "    We iterate through the original string again:\n",
    "    For each character, we check if its index is in the to_remove set. If it’s not, we append the character to result.\n",
    "    Finally, we join the characters in the result list to form the final valid string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution effectively handles several edge cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Empty String: Input \"\" → Output \"\" (remains empty).\n",
    "    No Parentheses: Input \"abc\" → Output \"abc\" (remains unchanged).\n",
    "    All Unmatched Parentheses: Input \"(((\" → Output \"\" (all are unmatched).\n",
    "    Mixed Characters: Input \"a)(b(c)d)\" → Output \"ab(c)d\" (removes unmatched parentheses).\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string twice: once to identify invalid parentheses and once to build the result.\n",
    "    Space Complexity: O(n) in the worst case for the to_remove set and the result list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Follow-Up Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "    How can you modify the solution to count the number of removed parentheses?\n",
    "\n",
    "        You could maintain a counter alongside the to_remove set to keep track of how many parentheses are marked for removal.\n",
    "    What if you were asked to return all valid strings that can be formed?\n",
    "\n",
    "        This would require a different approach, potentially involving backtracking to generate all valid combinations.\n",
    "    How would you handle a string with different types of parentheses, such as {}, [], or ()?\n",
    "\n",
    "        The logic can be extended to use a mapping of opening and closing parentheses, and you’d adjust the matching logic accordingly."
