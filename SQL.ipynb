    "    \n",
    "Handling Topics with IFNULL:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The IFNULL function is used to return 'Ambiguous!' if there are no topic_ids found for a post. This ensures that posts without any matching keywords clearly indicate ambiguity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining Keywords with Posts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    A LEFT JOIN connects the Posts table (P) with the Keywords table (K).\n",
    "    The join condition uses a LIKE statement to match keywords in a case-insensitive manner. The CONCAT function adds spaces around both the post content and the keyword, ensuring that only whole words are matched (e.g., it prevents partial matches like 'hand' in 'handball').\n",
    "    \n",

    "    Time Complexity: The time complexity is approximately O(M * N), where M is the number of posts and N is the number of keywords. This complexity arises from the need to check each keyword against the content of each post.\n",

    "    Purpose: Split each post's content into individual words (lowercased) so that they can be matched with keywords.\n",
    "    Operation: unnest(string_to_array(...)) splits the content into an array of words, then unnests them into separate rows for each post_id.\n",
    "    Complexity: Assuming there are n posts and each post has an average of m words, this step has O(n * m) complexity due to unnesting each word in each post.\n",
    "\n",
    "valid CTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Identify valid topic matches by joining the words from each post with keywords.\n",
    "    Operation: A LEFT JOIN between words and keywords is performed to find matches between the lowercased word and the keywords.\n",
    "    Complexity: For k keywords and n * m rows from words, the join has approximately O((n * m) * k) complexity, assuming no indexing optimizations.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Output: Produces distinct combinations of post_id and topic_id, ensuring that each relevant topic for a post appears only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "combine CTE:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Aggregate topic IDs for each post_id into a single comma-separated string.\n",
    "    Operation: Uses STRING_AGG to concatenate the distinct topic_ids for each post_id.\n",
    "    Complexity: Since combine processes O(n) post IDs and aggregates topics per post, the complexity here is roughly O(n).\n",
    "Final SELECT Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Purpose: Produce the final output where each post_id has either a list of associated topics or the label \"Ambiguous!\" if no topics were found.\n",
    "    Operation: Uses a CASE statement to replace NULL topic lists with \"Ambiguous!\".\n",
    "    Complexity: This step is O(n) as it scans each post ID to check for NULL values.\n",
    "    Complexity Summary\n",

    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "No Keywords Match a Post:\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a post contains no words that match any keywords, it will have no topic_id in the valid CTE, and the final output will show \"Ambiguous!\" for that post_id.\n",
    "Case Sensitivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "    All comparisons are case-insensitive due to the use of LOWER() on both content and keywords. This prevents case mismatches from affecting the output.\n",
    "Empty Content:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Posts with empty content fields will have no rows generated in words and will ultimately appear as \"Ambiguous!\" in the final output.\n",
    "Multiple Matches per Post:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Posts containing multiple Tinstances of the same keyword still show only one instance per topic due to the use of DISTINCT in the valid CTE. his avoids duplicate topic_ids in the final list.\n",

    "    The purpose of this query is to identify friendships with a significant connection through mutual friends, which can be useful for social network analysis, recommendations, or understanding user connectivity in social platforms.\n",
    "    The approach leverages SQL's ability to handle sets and joins to efficiently determine relationships between data points.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Steps to Execute the Query\n",
    "\n",
    "    Define the common friends using a CTE to normalize the friendship data.\n",
    "    Join the friendship data back to the CTE to find pairs of friends and their common friends.\n",
    "    Count the number of common friends for each pair.\n",
    "    Filter the results to only include pairs with three or more common friends.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Edge Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "    No Common Friends: If no pairs have at least three common friends, the result will be an empty set.\n",
    "    Self-Friendships: If a user is listed as their own friend, this could affect counts if not handled correctly (typically, self-references should be excluded).\n",
    "    Duplicate Entries: If the Friendship table contains duplicate entries for the same friendship, this could inflate the count of common friends unless distinct pairs are ensured.\n",
    "    Zero Friendship Records: If there are no entries in the Friendship table, the query will return an empty result set.\n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: The complexity mainly arises from the joins and the counting of common friends. Assuming n is the number of rows in the Friendship table:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The CTE f will create approximately 2n rows.\n",
    "    The joins could lead to n^2 complexity in the worst case (if every user is friends with every other user).\n",
    "    The final grouping and counting will also contribute to complexity, leading to an overall time complexity of O(n^ 2) in the worst-case scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity: The CTE f uses space proportional to the number of friendships (up to 2n rows), plus additional space for the join results. Thus, space complexity can also reach  O(n)."
