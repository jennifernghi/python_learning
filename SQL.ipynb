    "Ranking and Calculating Inversions:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The ranks help in identifying the sequence of days, facilitating the detection of continuous intervals.\n",

    "    No Data for 2019: If both Failed and Succeeded tables have no entries for the year 2019, the output will be empty, as there are no dates to evaluate.\n",
    "    Continuous Successes or Failures: If all tasks are either successful or failed for the entire year, the output will consist of a single row capturing the entire range of the year (e.g., all succeeded from 2019-01-01 to 2019-12-31).\n",
    "    Interleaved Dates: If there are entries with multiple successes and failures on the same day, the ranks will correctly allow for the periods to be recognized and separated, ensuring accurate output.\n",
    "    Dates Without Both States: If a day appears in one state but not the other, the query will still generate results for those continuous periods, ensuring that no gaps are overlooked.\n",

    "    The query explicitly filters dates to fall within the year 2019, thus it does not include entries from the previous or following year, avoiding incorrect aggregations.\n",

    "\n",
    "Time Complexity: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The time complexity of this query is O(N log N), where N is the total number of entries across both the Failed and Succeeded tables. This is primarily due to the use of the RANK() function, which involves sorting the records by date.\n",
    "    The final grouping and aggregation step (using GROUP BY) also contributes to the overall complexity but is generally linear with respect to the number of groups formed.\n",
