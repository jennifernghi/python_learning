    "The Traffic Light Controlled Intersection problem on LeetCode requires you to simulate the operation of traffic lights at an intersection where multiple cars can pass based on certain constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Description\n",
    "You are given three functions for cars coming from three different directions (East, North, and West), and these cars must pass through an intersection that is controlled by a traffic light. The traffic light allows only one direction to pass at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each function (carArrives) represents the arrival of a car at the intersection. If the traffic light is green for the direction from which the car is coming, the car can pass; otherwise, the car must wait until the light turns green.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to implement the simulation of this intersection, making sure cars pass in the correct order based on the traffic light rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach\n",
    "The key here is to use synchronization to make sure only one direction's cars can pass at a time, as well as ensuring that cars are only allowed to pass when their traffic light is green.\n",
    "\n",
    "A mutex lock or other thread synchronization mechanisms can be used to coordinate the passing of cars from different directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "Lock Mechanism: Use a lock to ensure only one car passes at a time.\n",
    "Green Light Condition: Maintain a \"green light\" state that indicates which direction is allowed to pass.\n",
    "Waiting: If a car arrives when the light is not green for its direction, it must wait.\n",
    "Change of Light: After a car passes, change the light for the next set of cars."
