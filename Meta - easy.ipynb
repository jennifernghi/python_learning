    "# Valid Word Abbreviation\n",
    " \n",
    "https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-word-abbreviation/description/\n",
    "A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. The lengths should not have leading zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a string such as \"substitution\" could be abbreviated as (but not limited to):\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"s10n\" (\"s ubstitutio n\")\n",
    "- \"sub4u4\" (\"sub stit u tion\")\n",
    "- \"12\" (\"substitution\")\n",
    "- \"su3i1u2on\" (\"su bst i t u ti on\")\n",
    "- \"substitution\" (no substrings replaced)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are not valid abbreviations:\n",
    "- \"s55n\" (\"s ubsti tutio n\", the replaced substrings are adjacent)\n",
    "- \"s010n\" (has leading zeros)\n",
    "- \"s0ubstitution\" (replaces an empty substring)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string word and an abbreviation abbr, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: word = \"internationalization\", abbr = \"i12iz4n\"\n",
    "- Output: true\n",
    "- Explanation: The word \"internationalization\" can be abbreviated as \"i12iz4n\" (\"i nternational iz atio n\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "- Input: word = \"apple\", abbr = \"a2e\"\n",
    "- Output: false\n",
    "- Explanation: The word \"apple\" cannot be abbreviated as \"a2e\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Problem Statement \n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The problem asks us to determine if a given abbreviation is valid for a target word. An abbreviation is considered valid if it can be derived from the target word by replacing one or more consecutive letters with their count. For example, 'a10n' is a valid abbreviation for 'abbreviation' because it represents the 10 letters between 'a' and 'n'.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Example to Illustrate\n",
    " \n",
    "- “For instance, consider the target word 'internationalization' and the abbreviation 'i12iz'. This is valid because it represents the letters between 'i' and 'z' (which are 12 characters long). However, 'i11iz' would not be valid because there are only 10 characters between 'i' and 'z'.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Approach\n",
    " \n",
    "a. Two-Pointer Technique\n",
    "- \"We will use a two-pointer technique to compare the characters in the target word and the abbreviation. One pointer will traverse the target word, and the other will traverse the abbreviation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Processing the Abbreviation\n",
    "\n",
    "- *\"As we process the abbreviation:\n",
    "    - If the current character is a letter, we check if it matches the current character in the target word. If it does, we move both pointers forward.\n",
    "    - If the current character is a digit, we need to handle it as a count of skipped characters in the target word. We extract the full number (which can be more than one digit) and advance the pointer in the target word accordingly, skipping that many characters.”*\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Validation\n",
    "- \"After processing both the abbreviation and the target word, we ensure that we've traversed the entire abbreviation and that our pointer has reached the end of the target word.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Discuss the time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"The time complexity of this approach is  O(N+M), where N is the length of the target word and M is the length of the abbreviation. This is because we traverse both strings at most once. The space complexity is O(1) since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Code Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the implementation of the solution:"

    "        Track missing numbers starting from 1 up to the last element in arr.\n",
    "        Count the gaps of missing integers between consecutive elements of arr.\n",

    "    Handle Missing Integers Before the Array Starts: If k is less than the first element in arr, the kth missing positive integer is simply k.\n",
    "    Adjust for Initial Missing Numbers: Calculate the initial gap between 1 and arr[0] (if any) and reduce k by this amount.\n",
    "    Loop Through Array Gaps: For each consecutive pair (arr[i], arr[i+1]), calculate the missing integers between them:\n",
    "        If the missing count in this gap is enough to cover k, return the kth missing integer within this gap.\n",

    "    Initial Check for k Before the Array: If k < arr[0], return k directly since the kth missing number lies before arr[0].\n",
    "    Adjust k for Missing Before First Element: Reduce k by arr[0] - 1, which accounts for the count of missing numbers between 1 and arr[0].\n",
    "    Loop through Gaps: For each gap, calculate the number of missing integers:\n",
    "        If k fits in the current gap, return the missing integer as arr[i] + k.\n",
    "        Otherwise, reduce k by the missing count and continue.\n",
    "    After Last Element: If we finish the loop and still have a positive k, return arr[-1] + k, indicating the missing integer is beyond the array.\n",

    "    We need to check if there are two elements in a Binary Search Tree (BST) that add up to a given value k. This problem resembles the classic \"Two Sum\" problem but on a BST. Due to the BST properties, we can leverage a combination of in-order traversal and a hash set to check if the required pair exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach (Recursive Solution)\n",
    "\n",
    "    In-Order Traversal: Using in-order traversal on a BST gives us nodes in sorted order. We can use this to go through each node in the tree.\n",
    "    Hash Set for Complements: As we traverse each node, we calculate the complement needed to reach k (i.e., k−node.val). If this complement exists in our hash set, we’ve found two nodes that sum up to k and can return True.\n",
    "    Recursive Traversal: Traverse the BST recursively, checking each node, adding it to the set, and looking for the complement.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Explanation of Code and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "    DFS Traversal: We perform depth-first search (DFS) using recursion, which allows us to traverse the BST and check each node.\n",
    "    Complement Check: For each node, we calculate k - node.val and check if it exists in seen. If it does, we’ve found our pair, and we return True.\n",
    "    Add to Set: If no match is found, we add node.val to seen and continue our search.\n",
    "    Recursive Call: We continue the search on both left and right children, returning True if either subtree finds a valid pair.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "    Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST, as each node is visited once.\n",
